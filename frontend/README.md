# SignBridge Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite + Tauri)

This project is a cross-platform Edge app built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tauri. It can run as a modern web app in the browser or as a native desktop app (Windows, macOS, Linux) using Tauri.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Backend Requirement**
- **You must have the backend server running at `http://localhost:8000`** for the app to function (both in browser and Tauri desktop modes).
- See the backend's `README.md` for setup and run instructions.
- _Tip: In the future, the backend and frontend will be bundled together for a seamless experience. For now, you must run the backend manually._
---

## üåê Running in the Browser (Web Only)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the backend:**
   - See backend/README.md for details.
3. **Run the frontend in dev mode:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running as a Tauri Desktop App (Cross-Platform)

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/):
  ```sh
  npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
  ```
- Backend running at `http://localhost:8000`

### Steps
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the backend:**
   - See backend/README.md for details.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     cd ../backend
     source py311_venv/bin/activate
     uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
     ```
3. **Run the Tauri app:**
   ```sh
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```
   - This will launch the desktop app. The frontend will be served by Vite at `http://localhost:5173` and Tauri will wrap it as a native app.

4. **Build for production (native desktop app):**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   - The built app will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` for your platform.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- The backend **must** be running at `http://localhost:8000` for the app to function.
- In the future, the backend and frontend will be bundled together for a seamless experience. For now, run the backend manually (see backend/README.md).
- For cross-platform builds, see the Tauri documentation and backend/README.md for backend packaging.
