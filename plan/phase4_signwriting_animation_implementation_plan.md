# Phase 4: SignWriting to Animation Rendering - Implementation Plan

## Summary

This phase focuses on integrating the SignWriting animation rendering into the SignBridge frontend, leveraging the existing animation code from the sign.mt repository.

## Key Components to Integrate

- **AnimationComponent**: Angular component using `<model-viewer>` for 3D rendering.
- **ThreeService**: Service providing Three.js utilities for animation.
- **AssetsService**: Service managing 3D model assets loading.
- **Animation State Management**: NGXS store managing animation tracks and updates.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Frontend Framework Setup**
   - Adapt the Angular animation component logic to Tauri frontend using JavaScript/TypeScript.
   - Use the `<model-viewer>` web component for 3D model rendering.

2. **Three.js Integration**
   - Implement a service/module similar to `ThreeService` to load and provide Three.js classes.
   - Use Three.js animation classes (`QuaternionKeyframeTrack`, `AnimationClip`) to create and play animations.

3. **Asset Management**
   - Implement asset loading similar to `AssetsService` to fetch 3D character models.
   - Support platform-specific assets (e.g., `.glb` for general, `.usdz` for iOS).

4. **Animation State Handling**
   - Design a state management solution to hold animation tracks.
   - Subscribe to state changes and update animations in real-time.

5. **Styling and UI**
   - Apply necessary styles to the animation canvas or model viewer.
   - Support right-to-left document direction if needed.

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Ensure smooth animation playback on Snapdragon X Elite and desktop.
   - Optimize Three.js rendering and resource loading.

7. **Testing**
   - Test animation rendering with sample SignWriting data.
   - Verify synchronization with transcription and translation pipeline.

## Additional Notes

- The animation rendering is primarily frontend-focused; backend involvement is minimal.
- Consider modularizing animation code for reuse and maintainability.
- Explore potential for future enhancements like reverse mode or additional sign languages.

## Deliverables

- Adapted animation component for Tauri frontend.
- Three.js service/module for animation utilities.
- Asset loading and management system.
- Real-time animation rendering integrated with backend data.
- Documentation of implementation and usage.
