# Phase 4: SignWriting to Animation Rendering

## Objective
Render SignWriting notation as animated sign language on-screen with good performance on target platforms.

## Tasks
1. Evaluate existing animation code from sign.mt (https://github.com/sign/translate).
2. Integrate animation renderer into frontend (Tauri) or backend as needed.
3. Optimize rendering performance for Snapdragon X Elite and desktop platforms.
4. Implement live animation display in the UI.
5. Test animation smoothness and synchronization with transcription.

## Resources

## Deliverables
- Integrated SignWriting animation renderer.
- Real-time animation display in frontend.
- Performance benchmarks on target devices.
